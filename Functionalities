This Python script is a voice-controlled AI assistant with multiple functionalities. It listens to voice commands, processes them, and performs various tasks, including:

1. **Voice Interaction & AI Chat**
Uses speech recognition (speech_recognition library) to take voice commands.
Uses Google Gemini AI (google.generativeai) to handle chatbot responses when "AI mode" is activated.
Converts text to speech using pyttsx3 for verbal responses.
2. **Web & Search Capabilities**
Google & YouTube Search – Opens search results based on voice commands.
Google Maps Directions – Finds directions from one place to another.
3. **System Control & Automation**
Open & Close Applications – Launches or closes apps like Messenger, WhatsApp, Spotify, YouTube, Chrome, Notepad, etc.
Task Manager Shortcut – Opens the Windows Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
System Commands – Supports shutdown, restart, and sleep commands.
4. **Email & Messaging**
Check Emails – Connects to Gmail (imaplib) and informs if there are new messages.
Send Messages – Automates message sending on Messenger and WhatsApp using pyautogui.
5. ** Brightness Control**
Adjust Screen Brightness – Increases, decreases, or sets a specific brightness level (screen_brightness_control).
6. **Weather & Date Information**
Weather Updates – Uses pyowm (OpenWeatherMap API) to provide weather forecasts, temperature, and sunrise/sunset times.
Date & Time Information – Tells today’s and tomorrow’s date and time when asked.
7. **Web Automation & Online Services**
Google Casting (Chromecast Control) – Automates media casting to a monitor/laptop using Chrome.
YouTube Video Controls – Can pause/play YouTube videos and go to the next one using shortcuts.
8. **Voice-Activated Script Execution**
Runs custom Python scripts based on voice commands.
9. **AI Mode (Gemini API Integration)**
If the user asks for "AI mode", the script switches to an AI chatbot mode using Google Gemini AI (previously commented-out OpenAI API).
10. **Calendar & Scheduling**
Adds new events to a Windows calendar or Fantastical app using keyboard automation (pyautogui).
Main Components Used
✅ Libraries: speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pyautogui, pyowm, imaplib, subprocess, webbrowser, datetime
✅ API Integrations: OpenWeatherMap (pyowm), Google Gemini AI (google.generativeai)
✅ System Control: Windows commands (os.system), brightness control, application launching

Summary
This is an AI-powered virtual assistant that listens to commands, interacts with the user, performs web searches, controls the system (brightness, shutdown, apps), checks emails, automates messaging, provides weather updates, and even runs Python scripts.
